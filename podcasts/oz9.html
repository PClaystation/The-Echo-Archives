    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Oz 9 is a space comedy following the wildly incompetent crew of a spaceship called the Oz 9. Built by a shady corporation named Gated Galaxies, the ship was supposedly designed to transport rich people across the universe to colonize new planets — but as the journey unfolds, it becomes clear that’s not its only purpose. The Oz 9, in particular, is staffed by a crew of stunningly stupid idiots and a somewhat horny AI, and together they stumble their way through one disaster after another in deep space.</p>
    <p><strong>Own Thoughts:</strong> I wasn’t the biggest fan of Oz 9 at first — it took a while to get going, and I usually prefer more serious audio dramas. This was the exact opposite of that. That said, it does get more interesting after the first season, and I get why some people really love it. It’s chaotic, unserious, and definitely has its moments. Not for me, but not bad either — just not my style.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want a funny, light podcast that doesn’t take itself seriously.</p>
    <p><strong>Similar to:</strong> Station 151, EOS 10, Wolf 359</p>
